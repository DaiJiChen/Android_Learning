# Activities



## 1. Activity Lifecycle

There are 6 activity lifecycle methods. You just override them when needed.

***onCreate()***: Create views and bind data to lists.

***onStart()***: Becomes visible to user after call onStart().

***onResume()***: Activity is at the top of the activity stack and captures all user input.

Which methods will be called when you press `Back Button`: onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy().

Which methods will be called when you press `Home Button`: onPause(), onStop().

What happen when you `rotate your screen`: current activity will be destroyed and then been resumed again. Called method is: onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy(), onCreate(), onStart(), onResume().

In order to hold the same data across rotation, we should save date and use them to build the new activity.

One way is using ` protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState)`.
   
   This method is called before onStop(), except when the user presses the Back button. The default implementation of onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) directs all of the activityâ€™s views to save their state as data in the Bundle object. A Bundle is a structure that maps string keys to values of certain limited types.
```java
public class QuizActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_quiz);
        ...
        if (savedInstanceState != null) {
            mCurrentIndex = savedInstanceState.getInt(someKey, 0);
        }
        ...
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
         super.onSaveInstanceState(savedInstanceState);
         ...
         savedInstanceState.putInt(someKey, someValue);
         ...
    }
}
```

After onStop() is called, activity will be marked as killable and memory might be token away. But don't worry, because we already execured onSaveInstanceState(). The `bunlde` object is stored into this activity's `activity record` by the OS. This record only been deleted after onDestroy() is called.
